Collections on Vaccination Discourse by Politicians

## Content

We made available the following output from our annotation system:

CovidPol_Corpus_2.0.csv: The final corpus in Brazilian Portuguese with stance, sentiment and relevance annotations after considering the majority of annotators, also indicating the tweet id and date of the post

For the relevant column, the value 0 indicates that the tweet, even though it contains the keywords used in the search, is not related to Covid-19 Vaccines. 1 indicate that it is related to Covid-19 vaccines.

The final_stance column has three categories: favorable, unfavorable and unclear towards COVID-19 vaccines.

final_sentiment also has three categories: positive, negative and unclear. Sentiment was annotated considering the overall sentiment expressed in the text, not in relation to COVID-19 vaccines;

Lastly, the final_children column indicates if the tweet is related to vaccination in Children. False indicates no relation, and True indicates that the tweet is about childrens' vaccination.

Codebook: We also provide the codebook with informations on the dataset building process, classification rules and some additional content.
